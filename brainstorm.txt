Draw mountains, clouds and background in separate vector!

Idea 1 - Map

VIDEO LOOP

mountain : vector_pos
cloud : vector_pos
sky : vector_pos

mountain(0) <= x"" (...)

Draw the sky everytime first
Draw every mountain position using same vector logic 
Draw clouds using same logic

Draw very fast, no delay

From now on, draw Flippy, the pipes and the rest 

Go back to drawing scenario


Idea 2 - Moving Clouds
Same logic as pipes, move positions in process, erase previous pos
Try to make it be below everyone else (minus sky)

Idea 3 - Title Card, Credits, Pause
